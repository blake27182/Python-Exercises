# Python-Exercises
This is a collection of exercises done to begin learning python in the summer of 2018
I am completely self-taught in python. I've taken several classes based in C++ and java though which have helped me understand a lot of common principles like class declarations, definitions, constructors, pointers, private public, and protected members, in and out streams and so-forth. I would consider python my strongest language, since I use it the most in my personal projects.
